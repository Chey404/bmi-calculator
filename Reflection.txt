For this project, I utilized ChatGPT to create the inital index.html form and BMI range table. I 
created the Calculate BMI function and I prompted Copilot to if/else statements that determine the
BMI category based on the result. After my base applicaiton was finished, I edited the HTML text
to more accurately fit the assignment. For example, the 'Export BMI Results' button was named 'Generate CSV' 
by the AI. Something I found interesting was how different the "exportCSV" generated from ChatGPT vs Copilot
were. In this project, the CSV headers were harcoded in the 'const rows,' and the reults were pulled from the 
calcauteBMI function variables (generated from ChatGPT). However in my financial calulator project, the csv headers and rows were pulled 
from the html and formatted into a CSV (generated form Copilot). In my opinion, the solution in this project for the exportCSV funciton is better, and I'll
be using similar logic going forward if I need to export a CSV.
